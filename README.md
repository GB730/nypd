# Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes Analysis
New York City has the highest population density in the United States with an estimated 8.5 million people as of 2016. Maintaining and enhancing the transportation infrastructure to promote the safety of the city’s millions of motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians is especially challenging given traffic volumes. To that end, our team seeks to perform an analysis of 2018 NYPD motor vehicle collision data to explore the relationship between “contributing factors” to accidents (as defined by the NYPD) and accident volumes. Based on the results of this analysis, we will provide targeted recommendations for mitigating the primary contributing factors to motor vehicle collisions.

The purpose is to have high level understanding with Python, principle and concept relating to data life cycle. Becoming familiar with these principles and Python will allows us to analyze motor vehicle collision data and provide recommendations. Additionally, exploring open data enable us to be more active in society and provide us an understanding on what questions to ask, setting up clear measurement priorities, and interpret results from analyzed data.
